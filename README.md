# Arduino-Thermometer_V1
That´s an improved version of the projekt "Love-0-Meter" from the official Arduino Uno book. It´s basically just a thermometer with a bigger LED-scale. 
Just build the project as shown in the circuit diagram and upload the code to your Arduino. 
If you want to check out how the project works you can watch my video: https://youtu.be/8hUdwcDhTcY (It´s in German but you can still see how it works.)

Please note that the code is in a compressed file that you can easyly decompress by using the software 7-Zip: https://7-zip.de/index.html
